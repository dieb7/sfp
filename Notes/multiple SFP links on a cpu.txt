multiple SFP links on a cpu

1. all run same protocol
  - much like main
  - polling is only used on master spi links

2. SFSP on SPI and SFAP on async
  - protocol selectable
  - same services
  - frame routing will have to reframe
  - versions for 8 and 16 bit checksum?

3. Refactor packets.c
  + should not know SFSP or SFAP
    - return value should set frame free or not? no
      - how to use from one protocol to the next? copy
  - need to hang on to packet if it is to be rerouted
    - SPS from end to end
  + specific packet handlers need to be moved to specific app files
    > SHELL_COMMANDS, SHELL_OUTPUT, TIMBRE

4. Who do I link to
  - each end of a link is connected to the other end by hardware
  - to connect to other end points routing is involved
  - routing to a destination is straight forward and can be
    accomplished by routing tables on each link
  - the routing tables should have default settings
  - the tables should be readable and writeable
  - some packets require responses end to end
  - the weak links are at routing points when a packet cannot
    be forwarded
  - SPS works between points but not over routing
  - end to end routing with confirmation is beyond SPS
  - when rerouting, the source packet service is not known and
    can't be used to choose a destination service
  - output back over a point is the same as routing it through a
    point.

 - memory leak; how to catch it
