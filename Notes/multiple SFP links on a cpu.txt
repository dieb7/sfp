multiple SFP links on a cpu

1. all run same protocol
  - much like main
  - polling is only used on master spi links

4. Who do I link to
  - each end of a link is connected to the other end by hardware
  - to connect to other end points routing is involved
  - routing to a destination is straight forward and can be
    accomplished by routing tables on each link
  - the routing tables should have default settings
  - the tables should be readable and writeable
  - some packets require responses end to end
  - the weak links are at routing points when a packet cannot
    be forwarded
  - SPS works between points but not over routing
  - end to end routing with confirmation is beyond SPS
  - when rerouting, the source packet service is not known and
    can't be used to choose a destination service
  - output back over a point is the same as routing it through a
    point.
