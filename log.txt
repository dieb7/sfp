Log for SFP
 This log is kept with the source code and is refined as the source code changes
 providing a human readable summary of the past, present and future of the code
 base. As issues are encountered, they are entered under the Issues: section. As
 they are resolved or things are changed, they are entered under the Updates:
 section. Once they are no longer relavent, they are removed. The repository will
 contain tags or major milestones which delineate these removals so as to serve
 as a signpost in the source code development preventing the accumulation of clutter.

Issues:
 1. should be able to have multiple ports - links on the embedded processor with each
    one having interpret capabilities and the return output going to the correct port.
    If the port is SFP then by frame. If the port is serial, then by byte. The detection
    of protocol should automatically be done at the link and traffic handled
    appropriately.
 2. Parameters between embedded and host sides of SFP should be knowable. Settable in
    GUI on host. Exchanged in protocol between two ends of a link. This way both ends 
    of a link would respect each other’s limits. The maximum packet size would be the 
    lesser of the 2. Bigger packets would either not get sent, get flagged as too big, 
    allowed for, or segmented.
 3. link parameters should have a common file format for C and Python
 4. the whole system should have frames as a basis. The sfp frame is a union of all 
    possible frames. This makes it easier to pass it around, interpret it and reuse it. 
    The same frame that comes in can go out as a reply frame.
 5. negotiating frame for peer to peer, no network (perhaps a network equivelant) use
    to exchange parameters such as maximum frame length; network on/off; SPS service;
    get local time
 6. It is too easy to configure the state machines incorrectly and then cause a crash.
    Because there are functions involved, if the function is zero this will cause a crash
    if called. The order of setting up a link and then calling link inits is not
    obvious and if called in the wrong order, this situation can arise. Say a different
    function is set for serviceTx which doesn't use the putTx function and then the
    init is called subsequently, then the serviceTx is replaced with the default one
    which will call putTx which will crash. Perhaps a setFunctionsTx(...) should be
    called which will set all functions at once. Perhaps the defaults should not be
    0 so they can actually be called but they would either flag the error or print out
    the error. Could do the same kinda thing for links in a node. Instead of mandating
    a check for zero, there would be a link which would do nothing but work with all
    the calls. The philosophy is not to crash and to alert the programmer to changes
    that need to be made.
    Could also define defaults which just do most common thing but won't crash.
 7. make sps selectable and use long timeout for initial contact and short timeout for
    retransmission
 8. need to test new api:
 void queueFrame(sfpFrame *frame, Byte packetlength) // frame and queue a frame pool frame
    move towards single buffer moving through system - avoid copying.
 9. need api for information hiding of SPS: set, test, ?
Updates:
1. SPS enhanced for network mode - multiple reliable links between two nodes form a
   chain for reliable delivery • SPS packet sent across network is ACKed across each link
   • packet is routed to end point as an SPS packet
   • no end to end ACK but each link routes the SPS packets
   • delay is only link delay not network delay
2. Node 0 is default. Node numbering starts at 1. in a simple system with one link,
   0 and 1 are the same. when a node has multiple links, a link can be chosen to be
   0 or default but it also is associated with a route to other nodes. a route to
   node 0 gets the nodes default link. node 0 is reserved. using who 0,0 is direct
   or point to point over the zero link. when receiving a packet addressed to 0 it
   is taken as being for that node. routing information is null
3. SPS packets now have routing information
4. Using a general queue for frames which contain enough space for frame header
   and trailer. receiver and transmitter use the same frameq. a file called
   parameters.h is used to set sfp parameters
5. Machines have been factored out of SFP code. this makes it easier to integrate
   into threads, RTOSs, and other systems
6. Extensive test suite: unit testing has been applied throughout to the SFP code.
7. Code base has been refactored, cleaned up and rebuilt making use of the Test
   Suite to assure quality
8. Inclusion of most PIDs in networking - all but test frames for a single link
   and ACKs which are a link only PID, are networkable.
9. Subsumption of the terms SFAP and SFSP
10.Separation of parameters and network setup code
11.Consider combining cpu ids and pids into network thingees
